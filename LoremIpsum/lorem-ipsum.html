            <p>Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than
                mine. You don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same
                way to water. We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it
                may seem, we are connected, you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends. </p>

            <p class="pTwo">Now that we know who you are, I know who I am. I'm not a mistake! It all makes sense! In a comic, you
                know how you can tell who the arch-villain's going to be? He's the exact opposite of the hero. And most
                times they're friends, like you and me! I should've known way back when... You know why, David? Because
                of the kids. They called me Mr Glass. </p>

                I'm speaking with myself, number one, because I have a very good brain and I've said a lot of things. I
                know
                words. I have the best words. My text is long and beautiful, as, it has been well documented, are
                various
                other parts of my website.
            </p>

            <p class="pTwo">
                My text is long and beautiful, as, it has been well documented, are various other parts of my website.
                The
                other thing with Lorem Ipsum is that you have to take out its family. That other text? Sadly, itâ€™s no
                longer
                a 10.
            </p>

            <p>
                You have so many different things placeholder text has to be able to do, and I don't believe Lorem Ipsum
                has
                the stamina. We have so many things that we have to do better... and certainly ipsum is one of them.
                Some
                people have an ability to write placeholder text... It's an art you're basically born with. You either
                have
                it or you don't.
